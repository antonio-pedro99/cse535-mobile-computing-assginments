My code solutions to Mobile Computing's subject at IIITD
<h2>Sensing through the eyes of sensors</h2>
<p>.Collect data for the following sensors: Proximity, Light sensor, Geomagnetic rotation
vector sensor. Store the values of these sensors by creating separate tables in the
Room database. Store the values when the following condition happens. Sensors:
a. Proximity Sensor:
Log the proximity sensors’s data when the user places the phone near their ear
or cover the phone by hands. Hint: perform some trial runs to get an estimate of
the values of this sensor under diff conditions.
b. Light Sensor:
Log the light sensor’s data when the phone is covered or placed face down. Hint:
perform some trial runs to get an estimate of the values of this sensor under diff
conditions.
c. Geomagnetic rotation vector sensor: collect always </p>
